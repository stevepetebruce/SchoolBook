      <h2>Anne's Diary </h2>
      <p>
        Otto Frank, who had remained in Camp A, was the only member of the Frank family to survive long enough to see The Alliance liberation. He returned to the city where his family's last home was, the secret house, and went about trying to find his family. He learned that Edith, his wife had died and then later that his two daughters, Anne and Margot had also died in the camps. Over 100,000 Jews, men and women, boys and girls were forced to the camps. And only 5,000 had survived. Otto was one of those 5,000. 
      </p>
      <p>
        He knew that people had to learn the truth of what had happened to the Jews when Hitler's men invaded their home. The horrible way they were treated, not being allowed to drive a car, or go to the cinema. And how they had to hide for years in secret to save themselves. And being forced to live in the camps. And the killings and other horrors in the camps.
      </p>
      <p> 
        When he got back to the secret house, one of the good people who had helped him and the others, by bringing them food and games, etc, over the two years their were in hiding, gave him Anne's diary. In the diary was the truth, from a young, smart girl who had her whole life ahead of her. With her dreams of wanting to be a journalist and with gossip about boys, and film stars she liked and how her sister annoyed her. Anne was like another girl her age, but she was a girl who had lived through a horrific experience. And she had written it all down. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Otto decided to let the world see Anne's diary, so that she could inspire everyone who needed hope and strength in the darkest times, when there is no hope. Anne shows us that words and the truth can be more powerful than the hate and lies of evil people.
