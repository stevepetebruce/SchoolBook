        Finally the train stopped. The doors opened and all the people clambered to get out. They were in the middle of a large muddy field, where the train tracks just stopped in the middle of nowhere. This was Camp A. The field was surrounded by fences of wire that would cut you if you touched them and tall guard towers with soldiers who had massive lights and guns, so they could see and shoot anyone trying to escape.

        The people from the train were being dragged apart, the soldiers were pulling all the men to one side and all the women and children to the other. Otto fought to keep hold of Anne, Margot and Edith but he couldn't fight all the soldiers. Anne and the others were screaming at the soldiers, trying to get to Otto but they were ripped apart and pushed in with all the other women and children.
