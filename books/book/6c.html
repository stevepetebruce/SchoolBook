        The Alliance soldiers finally beat Hitler's soldiers who were guarding Camp B and they could not believe what they saw. Thousands of dead people lying in giant graves, with thousands more ill and starving people who were close to death themselves. The Alliance gave these poor people food, water and medical care else they too might die. Even though The Alliance tried to get to the camps as quickly as possible, it was too late for Anne and Margot.

      <p>
         A few weeks before The Alliance liberated Camp B, Margot had caught the bug that was spreading through the camp. She was so ill already she didn't have the strength to fight the disease. She died shortly after. Now Anne, was completely alone, not knowing what had happened to her mother and father and now had lost her sister. She too was ill, starving and shivering with the cold and disease. Anne died a few days after her sister. She was only 15 years old.
