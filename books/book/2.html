          <h3>At War</h3>
          <p>
            <span class="firstcharacter">I</span>n the middle of an unexceptional week, strange noises appeared here and there in the distance, in the darkest corners of the night. Guns were shot, glass was broken and men were shouting. War was finally unleashed: Hitler's army was invading the Franks new home country. 
            </p>
            <p>
            First the planes came, dropping their bombs, blowing up homes, factories and businesses. Then the planes released Hitler's men in parachutes so they could drop from the sky. Then his men came in vehicles and on foot. The local people fought the invaders bravely, there was so many of these men to fight it was hard to protect their home country. The fights were long and bloody.
          </p>
          <p>On the fourth day of fighting, Hitler ordered 100 of his planes with giant bombs to attack. These planes were so big, heavy and loud they made the earth rumble as they flew overhead.
          </p>
           	<div class="arrowup black"></div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="swiper-slide">
        <div id="content">
          <p>
             They flew slowly over to the battle and the people could hear the rumble of their engines as they approached. They had never seen anything like this before and they could not of known what damage the giant bombs in these planes could do. The planes drew closer and closer to their target city, which was miles from where the Frank family lived, but other families scared by these new weapons ran inside to hide from their attack. The planes were now over their target of the city. The pilots opened the bay doors and released the bombs. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Thousands of bombs were dropped and destroyed the heart of the city. The bombs and the fires they caused destroyed tens of thousands of peoples homes, making them homeless. This was too much. The people surrounded to Hitler's army and Otto, Edith, Margot and Anne, like everyone else, worried what now happen to them now Hitler was in power of their home.
          </p>
          <p>
            At first, after the fighting stopped, nothing much changed. It was just quiet.
          </p>

             Then week by week, things got worse and worse for the Frank family and other Jews. They were forced to wear a special badge at all times, so that Hitler's men could tell they were Jewish. They were forced to only go to school with children who were also Jewish. They were forbidden to go to the cinema. They had to give up their bicycles. They were not allowed to use cars, even their own. They could only shop between 3-5pm. They could not be outside of their house after 8pm. They could not go swimming, nor play sports, they could do very little that most people take for granted. They could not own a business, so Otto sold his business to a friend. Just when it seemed the strict rules could not get any worse, Margot, Anne's older sister received a letter telling her she was being sent to a camp where she would be forced to work for Hitler's men. This meant she may never see her family again. This was too much. Life was hell already and now they were splitting up Jewish families. They had to do something fast.
