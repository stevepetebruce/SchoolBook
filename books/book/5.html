			<h1> Chapter 5 </h1>  <h2>The Betrayal... </h2>
			
			<p>
				Just as the year was dipping back down into winter, the nights drawing longer and longer shadows, the residents of the secret house had patiently resigned themselves to the idea that would be spending another winter hidden away, keeping quiet, not knowing when it would be safe for Jewish people to walk around freely again. Anne was quietly packing up a game she was playing, putting the cards back into... There was a loud crash and a gang of uniformed men rushed out of the secret passage shouting and waving guns at all the people in the room. The Evil Lord's men had found them.
			</p>
			<p>
				The men ran through the rooms dragging out all of Anne's family and the others who had been hiding. Up the stairs they ran, into all the rooms, up into the attic, checking under beds, shouting at everyone and pushing them into one room. There was no point fighting, they had guns and it was best to just do what they told them to do. Anne, Otto and all the others were dragged out of the secret house down into the street that their feet last touched over two years ago.
			</p>
			<p>
				They were pushed into vans and driven to a building where they were questioned overnight by the Evil Lord's men... With little sleep, the next day they were all moved to a prison, The House of Detention. They had no idea where they would finally end up, the men were scary and it was frightening to think about what might happen in the next five minutes, so it was difficult to think what would happen in the future. 
			</p>
			<p>
				After two days in the prison they were moved north to a transit camp, where the Evil Lord's men would decide where to send them. After a month they were told to get on a train waiting in the grounds of the camp, as they boarded they still had no idea where they were going but at least they were still together as a family. They were on this train, with no seats, little water and food for days. It passed through fields, forests and towns. Three long days passed as the train travelled further and further into the darkness, away from their home, into strange countries they had never seen before. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Finally the train stopped. The doors opened and all the people clambered to get out. They were in the middle of a large muddy field, where the train tracks just stopped in the middle of nowhere. This was Camp A. The field was surrounded by fences of wire that would cut you if you touched them and tall guard towers with the Evil Lord's soldiers who had massive lights and guns, so they could see and shoot anyone trying to escape. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The people from the train were being dragged apart, the soldiers were pulling all the men to one side and all the women and children to the other. Otto fought to keep hold of Anne, Margot and Edith but he couldn't fight all the soldiers. Anne and the others were screaming at the soldiers, trying to get to Otto but they were ripped apart and pushed in with all the other women and children. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Evil Lord had his orders: Any one under 15 years old was to be killed. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Anne was 15 and three months old and so managed to escape this horror. She was moved with her elder sister and mother into a small hall, where they had all the hair on their heads shaved and a unique number tattooed on their arms, which was to be their name from now on. That night, Anne, Margot and their mother slept in bunk beds made of wood with no blankets in an over crowded, draughty hall. They had no idea where Otto was and could not sleep.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the morning, they found out what they would be doing that day, which would be the same as for every day while they were in Camp A. They were forced to move and carry rocks, or dig the earth all day. With only small amounts of bread to eat and with all heavy work, it was easy to get ill. Disease and death was everywhere in the camp. Soon Anne's skin was infected with bugs, so she was moved into a make shift hospital, still within the grounds of the camp. Here it was always dark and rats and mice ran around the bottom of the beds. Edith, Anne's mother, saved every bit of food for her daughters so they could be strong and have a chance of surviving this hell. 
			</p>
			<p>
				After two months, the soldiers in Camp A, started selecting women and girls to be moved to Camp B. More than 8,000 were chosen and yet more were left in Camp A. The soldiers didn't care who was related to who, or what each of the women wanted and Anne and her sister Margot were separated from their mother, Edith, who was left in Camp A.
			</p>
			<p>
				Anne and Edith travelled on a train hundreds of miles with hundreds of other girls and women from Camp A to Camp B. They had no idea why they were chosen or where they were going. They were hungry, sick and dirty, having not had any proper food or showers at the camp. They had not seen their father for months and were now separated from their mother. It was hard to remain hopeful about the future but they had to.
			</p>
			<p>
				At Camp B, they were housed in large tents, that were even colder than the sleeping halls they had to sleep in in Camp A. They were crammed in together and disease was now a real danger. Margot was too ill to leave her bed and Anne tried her best to get any food for sister and herself.
			</p>
			<p>
				As Spring was coming back around again, when free people were enjoying the longer, warmer days, life in the camp suddenly got even worse. A bug started being spreading through the camp, and because they were so ill already due to not eating for so long, the bug started killing people quickly through the camp.
