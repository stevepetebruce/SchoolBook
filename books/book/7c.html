      When he got back to the secret house, one of the good people who had helped him and the others, by bringing them food and games, etc, over the two years their were in hiding, gave him Anne's diary. In the diary was the truth, from a young, smart girl who had her whole life ahead of her. With her dreams of wanting to be a journalist and with gossip about boys, and film stars she liked and how her sister annoyed her. Anne was like another girl her age, but she was a girl who had lived through a horrific experience. And she had written it all down.

      Otto decided to let the world see Anne's diary, so that she could inspire everyone who needed hope and strength in the darkest times, when there is no hope. Anne shows us that words and the truth can be more powerful than the hate and lies of evil people.
