      Hitler had given his orders: anyone under 15 years old was to be killed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne was 15 <span class="italic">and three months old,</span> and so just managed to escape this horror. She was moved with her elder sister and mother into a small hall, where they had all the hair on their heads shaved off and a unique number tattooed on their arms, which was to be their name from now on. That night, Anne, Margot and their mother slept in bunk beds made of wood with no blankets in an over-crowded, draughty hall. They had no idea where Otto was and could not sleep because they were so worried.
    </p>

      In the morning, they found out what they would be doing that day, which would be the same as for every day while they were in Camp A. They were forced to move and carry rocks, or dig the earth all day. With only small amounts of bread to eat and with all the heavy work, it was easy to get ill. Disease and death was everywhere in the camp.
