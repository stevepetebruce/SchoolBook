      Margot was standing frozen on the corner of the rug, looking at Anne who, for one second, had forgotten 
      the silence they had to preserve. She bit her lip and froze too.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a few minutes of stillness, Anne slowly got down on her hands and knees and crawled to the edge of the rug to where bare wooden floorboards were exposed. Between the boards, in a particular spot, there was a gap where you could look down into the building below. She would sometimes look down and imagine herself walking around with the others: freely attending to business in the world below, not crawling on her hands and knees in silence above.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne knew she had made too much noise but as she looked down she saw two people below, talking as if they didn't hear her. 
      "It's OK," she mouthed to her sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think we're safe," she thought to herself. She breathed a little easier and Margot loosened her frozen statue pose whilst still giving her little sister Anne a dirty look.

      "CLUNK!"
