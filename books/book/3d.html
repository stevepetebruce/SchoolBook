      <p>Days went by. Very, very quiet days in their secret home. Only six people in the downstairs business offices knew that there was a whole family hiding upstairs. This six people would be the family's helpers, bringing them food and newspapers and books and games for the children. During the day, when the other workers were downstairs, they had to walk round on tip toes as to not arouse suspicion. At night, when there was no one working below, they could relax a little more but still had to make sure no lights could be seen from their rooms in the street outside.

      <p>After a week the Franks were joined by their friends, the van Pels family: Mum, Dad and their son Peter. And then, months later they were joined by another friend, Fritz. In the end there was: Otto, Edith, Anne, Margot, Mr &amp; Mrs van Peel, Peter and Fritz - EIGHT people living in each others pockets, day and night, every day of the week, in the secret house.
