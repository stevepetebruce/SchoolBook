      <p>Days went by - very, very quiet days in their secret home. Only six people in the downstairs business offices knew that there was a whole family hiding upstairs. These six people would be the family's helpers, bringing them food and newspapers and books and games for the children. During the day, when the other workers were downstairs, they had to walk round on tip toes so not to make a noise and arouse suspicion. At night, when there was no one working in the office below, they could relax a little more but still had to make sure that no one could see their lights on from the street below.

      <p>After a week the Franks were joined by their friends, the van Pels family: Mr and Mrs van Pels and their son Peter. And then, months later they were joined by another friend, Fritz. In the end there was: Otto, Edith, Anne, Margot, Mr and Mrs van Pels, Peter AND Fritz - EIGHT people living in each other's pockets, day and night, every day of the week, in the secret house.
