          <p>Jews were banned from doing some of the most simple things that everyone else took for granted.</p>

      Then, week by week, things got worse and worse for the Frank family and other Jews. They were forced to wear a  yellow badge at all times, so that Hitler's men could see they were Jewish. They were forced to go to school only with other Jewish children. They had to give up their bicycles. They were not allowed to use cars. They could only shop between 3-5pm. They could not leave their house after 8pm. They could not go swimming, nor play sports; they could not do what most people take for granted. They could not own a business, so Otto sold his business to a friend.

      Just when it seemed that the strict rules could not get any worse, Margot, Anne's older sister received a letter telling her that she was being sent to a camp where she would be forced to work for Hitler's men. This meant she might never see her family again. This was too much. Life was hell already and now they were splitting up Jewish families. They had to do something... fast.
