       <p>Then week by week, things got worse and worse for the Frank family and other Jews. They were forced to wear a special badge at all times, so that Hitler's men could tell they were Jewish. They were forced to only go to school with children who were also Jewish. They were forbidden to go to the cinema. They had to give up their bicycles. They were not allowed to use cars, even their own. They could only shop between 3-5pm. They could not be outside of their house after 8pm. They could not go swimming, nor play sports, they could do very little that most people take for granted. They could not own a business, so Otto sold his business to a friend. Just when it seemed the strict rules could not get any worse, Margot, Anne's older sister received a letter telling her she was being sent to a camp where she would be forced to work for Hitler's men. This meant she may never see her family again. This was too much. Life was hell already and now they were splitting up Jewish families. They had to do something fast.
