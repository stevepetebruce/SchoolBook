        <span class="firstcharacter">I</span>n the middle of an unexceptional week, strange noises appeared here and there in the distance, in the darkest corners of the night. Guns were shot, glass was broken and men were shouting. War was finally unleashed: Hitler's army was invading the Franks new home country. 
      </p>
      <p> First the planes came, dropping their bombs, blowing up homes, factories and businesses. Then the planes released Hitler's men in parachutes so they could drop from the sky. Then his men came in vehicles and on foot. The local people fought the invaders bravely, there was so many of these men to fight it was hard to protect their home country. The fights were long and bloody.

      On the fourth day of fighting, Hitler ordered 100 of his planes with giant bombs to attack. These planes were so big, heavy and loud they made the earth rumble as they flew overhead.
