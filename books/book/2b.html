Guns were shot, glass was broken and men were shouting. War was finally unleashed: Hitler's army was invading the Franks new home country. 
      </p>

Then his men came in vehicles and on foot. The local people fought the invaders bravely, there was so many of these men to fight it was hard to protect their home country. The fights were long and bloody.
