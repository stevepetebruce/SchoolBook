                  <p>
                    <span class="firstcharacter">I</span>n the middle of the city there was a large, average looking building. And in this building was the business offices that Otto had just sold to his friend. On the top floor of this business there was a bookcase. And behind this bookcase was a secret passage...

                    <p>
                      This passage led up some dark stairs into a secret house, hiding silently on top of the offices  below. Three stories tall, on the first level were two small rooms, with a bathroom and toilet. On the second level was a large open room with a small room beside it. And from this small room a ladder led up to the attic. It was in this secret house, that Otto, Anne and the rest of the Frank family went into hiding to keep out of sight of the Evil Lords men who had now started patrolling the streets looking for Jewish families.

                    It was July and whilst everyone was enjoying the Summer, Anne gave her friend: her favourite book, a tea set, a tin of marbles and her cat, Moortje, to look after. Otto wrote a note in which he pretended that he and his family were leaving the country, in case the Evil Lord's men came looking for them at their home. They packed a small amount of personal belongings and prepared to leave to go to their new hiding place. It would be the last time any of them would see their home.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That night, they all walked the few hundred metres from their home to their new hiding place being careful not to be seen. They quietly entered the building, went to the top of the business offices, and pulled the bookcase away from the wall. One by one they squeezed up the narrow secret passage into their new hiding place and finally Otto pulled the bookcase back against the wall. In the first floor room they took off their heavy jackets and dumped their belongings on the floor and took a moment to take in their new, secret home.

                    Days went by. Very, very quiet days in their secret home. Only six people in the downstairs business offices knew that there was a whole family hiding upstairs. This six people would be the family's helpers, bringing them food and newspapers and books and games for the children. During the day, when the other workers were downstairs, they had to walk round on tip toes as to not arouse suspicion. At night, when there was no one working below, they could relax a little more but still had to make sure no lights could be seen from their rooms in the street outside.

                    After a week the Franks were joined by their friends, the van Pels family: Mum, Dad and their son Peter. And then, months later they were joined by another friend, Fritz. In the end there was: Otto, Edith, Anne, Margot, Mr &amp; Mrs van Peel, Peter and Fritz - EIGHT people living day and night, every day of the week, in the secret house.
