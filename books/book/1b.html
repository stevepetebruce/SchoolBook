            And those born in peacetime just don't know how easily it is broken. They can not see the dark forces building just beyond the horizon; the coiled spring of war pushed tighter and tighter over times of peace, with unimaginable horror and pain bursting to be released.

            After The World War, there was a time of peace... and here, among the bustle of everyone else, lived a husband and wife, Otto and Edith Frank. They had two daughters lucky enough to be born into this time, Anne and Margot. They lived in a house just like everyone else's, in a land not very far away: Germany. Otto loved to read, he had a built up a great library of books and encouraged his daughters to read too. Anne, the youngest daughter, was only three but liked to flick through the pages of her Dad's books, looking for pictures and words she could understand.
